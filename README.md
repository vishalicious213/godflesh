# Godflesh Tribute Page

This is a customization of the first project in Scrimba's Module 6 (Responsive Design). The original design was a responsive remake of the first project in Module 4 (Essential CSS Concepts). I've converted it into a tribute page for the band, [Godflesh](https://godflesh.com/).
